## What is it?

FACTS-NFT is a project incubated at AppCívico that aims to create a new revenue stream line for journalism 100% based on NFT transactions. The initiative was launched in April 2020, bringing together four certified fact-checking organizations in different parts of the world: Agência Lupa (Brazil), Lead Stories (U.S), Newtral (Spain), and Taiwan Fact-Checking Center (Taiwan). In the first week of work, Facts-NFT sold five fact-checks (0.05 ETH each, $120), proving that the initiative was on the right path. There is a market for good journalism in the cryptocurrency universe. In May 2020, new batches of fact-checked content were converted in NFT format and were - again - rapidly sold. In every transaction, fact-checking organizations kept 86.5% of the total amount, in ETH. Now Facts-NFT will take one step further and, in the next 6 months, will test its process with newsrooms in Brazil.

> **NFTs ("Non-Fungible Tokens")** are one-of-a-kind tokens that represent a unique good or asset, like digital art. They can be sold in auctions for collectors to bid on or purchase, and the sale of NFTs unlock new revenue streams for creators.

> **Minting** is a process similar to the way that metal coins are minted and added into circulation. An NFT is how your fact check becomes a part of the Ethereum blockchain–a public ledger that is unchangeable and tamper-proof. Your fact check is represented as an NFT so it can then be purchased and traded in the market and digitally tracked as it is resold or collected again in the future.

## Where?

FACTS-NFT is available on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), a peer-to-peer marketplace where millions of investors buy, sell, and discover rare digital items every day. The collection will be released in seasons (every quarter) and updated here in the documentation as soon as announced. 

For each season, a collection of facts will be released by FACTS-NFT. Each media outlet can have its own collection of NFTs representing their articles, for instance. The buyer, on the other hand, just needs to select the fact check he/she would like to buy and authorize a cryptocurrency transaction. Bidders will be invited to follow fact check auctions and bid as if they were on an auction online house.
