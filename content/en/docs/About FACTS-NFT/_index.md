## What is it?

FACTS-NFT is the first marketplace for fact checks in NFT format. It aims to bring together important, historical, and fact-checked content and present it in a way that could attract cryptocurrency investors, international collectors, and/or anyone who feels its time to support the work that is currently being done by fact-checkers.

> **NFTs ("Non-Fungible Tokens")** are one-of-a-kind tokens that represent a unique good or asset, like digital art. They can be sold in auctions for collectors to bid on or purchase, and the sale of NFTs unlock new revenue streams for creators.

> **Minting** is a process similar to the way that metal coins are minted and added into circulation. An NFT is how your fact check becomes a part of the Ethereum blockchain–a public ledger that is unchangeable and tamper-proof. Your fact check is represented as an NFT so it can then be purchased and traded in the market and digitally tracked as it is resold or collected again in the future.

## Where?

FACTS-NFT is available on OpenSea, a peer-to-peer marketplace where millions of investors buy, sell, and discover rare digital items every day. The NBA, for example, is negotiating videos of its famous players top-shots and getting a lot of attention.

In the FACTS-NFT platform, each fact-checking organization will have its own collection of fact checks and can fix individual prices for each piece of their work. The organization will also be asked to choose between selling or auctioning its fact checks. The buyer, on the other hand, just needs to select the fact check he/she would like to buy and authorize a cryptocurrency transaction. Bidders will be invited to follow fact check auctions and bid as if they were on an auction online house.
