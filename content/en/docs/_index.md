This documentation was built with the ambition to let you understand what is NFTs and how can you navigate in this world.

As you may know (you will see further explanations on this topic), we as FACTS-NFT, we work with *facts*. We apply the NFT technology to be used for anyone that wants to collect facts and especially the media outlets that want to build NFTs using facts.

Throughout this guide, you will also learn how to buy, how to sell and you will be ready to start to explore this innovation.

Have a nice reading.
