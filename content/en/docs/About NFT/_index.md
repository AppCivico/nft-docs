A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique, individual token existing on a blockchain such as Ethereum. Unlike cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, each NFT token contains unique data meaning non-fungible tokens are not interchangeable with each other. This non-fungible nature of the tokens means their use cases differ greatly from their fungible counterparts.

NFTs are one-of-a-kind, digital representations of information or data where a holder has proof of ownership. NFTs and their corresponding ownership are recorded on the blockchain, which establishes NFTs verifiable digital scarcity and the uniqueness of each asset.

> Verifiable ownership is the main value driver for NFT collectors

NFTs are also transferable, thus allowing the creation of a secondary market, where holders can buy and sell non-fungible tokens.

While the recent wave of NFTs has taken off with art and collectibles, the application is truly endless and has far reaching implications with the digitized world
we live in today. Younger generations interact moreso online than offline. 

People are learning to place value on digital identity and reputation more than ever before. This isnâ€™t attributable solely to art or music becoming digitized, but even social interactions or personal thoughts posted on Twitter, for instance. 

You will learn further in this documentation how we can use NFTs for journalism and use NFTs to represent facts.
