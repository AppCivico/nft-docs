Before learning how to buy and sell NFTs and install your wallet, it is essential to understand that you will need to learn how to connect the traditional finance system (e.g. Your bank account) to the crypto world.

It means that you will need to open an account in one crypto exchange. In a second moment, you will need to make the first deposit to your brand-new account. Further, you will be able to buy a digital asset such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. It is not so different when opening an account with a broker to buy stocks, for instance. We call this *fiat on-ramp*, because it is how fiat money (e.g., Dollar, euro) can access the crypto ecosystem.

## Step 1. How to open an account on a crypto exchange

A short disclaimer: It is up to you to make the choice of which crypto exchange you want to open an account. It is not our responsibility to make a choice, and we cannot recommend any crypto exchange. What we can do, is to list a few crypto exchanges as a reference. You should check if they are legally operating in your region.

In general, despite the process vary for each exchange, there is a typical general process when opening an account. It would be best to navigate the exchange website and then sign up for a new account. Due to KYC Rules (Know Your Customer), you should provide personal information to validate your account.

## Step 2. How to transfer money and buy crypto

As soon as your account is validated, you will be able to make deposits.
The crypto exchange will provide instructions on how to wire the amount you want. Usually, they will provide their bank account where you can use it as a destination.

You will need to transfer from your bank account to the crypto exchange's bank account. Once the deposit arrives (it can take a few days), the amount will appear on the crypto exchange website.

## Step 3. Buying a digital asset

Let's say you want to buy Ether (the transactional token of the Ethereum network) using Dollars. You need to look for the pair ETH/USD and then purchase the Ethers you want.

Finally, you will have Ethers in your account. You will be able to use it in the Ethereum network to perform several actions you want. For instance, you will be able to buy an NFT. You can transfer this Ether to another wallet (outside of the exchange). 

```In the crypto world, you can have a personal wallet that belongs only to you and not inside a centralized structure. It is like having a bank account out of a bank. ```

You will learn how to install your wallet and transfer it to this wallet in the next section.
