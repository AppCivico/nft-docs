You will need to have an Ethereum address in order to receive the revenue from the sales.

If your organization does not have an Ethereum address, you should create it previously to start sending an NFT proposal. There are many ways to create an address and several wallets you can use. Below we will give an example by how to do it using one of the most popular browser extensions for Ethereum: metamask.

## Step 1. Install MetaMask on your browser[#](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/metamask/hello/#step-1-install-metamask-on-your-browser)
