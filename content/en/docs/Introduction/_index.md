One of the most difficult issues our digital society faces today is the rapid spread of dis/misinformation and the impact it has on our lives. Falsehoods can easily fuel hate speech, weaken democracies and become a real-life threat. Research has shown that disinformation can affect studentâ€™s grades, can be harmful to our health, and makes it harder for people to accept the truth.

Journalism is a pillar for all democracies, but it desperately needs financial support. The cryptocurrency and the NFTs universe, on the other hand, is full of investors but lacks a cause, a purpose beyond finance. So Facts-NFT will bring these two groups together. The initiative aims to launch and raise a new revenue stream line for media outlets, by offering them the opportunity to sell their content in the non-fungible token (NFT) format. Cryptocurrency owners and NFT collectors will then have the chance to express their support for good reporting, while also investing in a fast-growing market.
